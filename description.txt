When I was young, I often played Tetris game. So I want to realise it on MicroBit.The Teris game have four type bricks, you can press button to move and rotate the brick.When the bricks touch the top, game over.
Firstly I want to make it by accelerometer.Fortunately, When I read the MicroPython doc, I find the demo project "Move the device to avoid the obstacles."(https://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/accelerometer.html). This project is similar to Teris game. The obstacle fall from the top, and we move on bottom.So I can change it into brick fall from the top ,and move the brick, add the rotate operation by press the button_a and button_b meanwhile.
But it's hard to precise control the brick where we want to place it, and it often caused failed on the small board. So I change the accelerometor into press the button.Press button_a to move left press button_b move to move right and both press to rotate.Through press button, we can place the bricks accurately.
I also creat an two-dimension array to save the board status. I create move function to move the brick. When brick fall down, check whether it can remove in a line, and change the array value. Through the array, we can remove brick in a line and judge the game whether end ,what's more ,we can display the borad by array value.
